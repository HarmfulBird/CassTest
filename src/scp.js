    "Subject": "SCP-002",
    "Class": "Euclid",
    "Description": "SCP-002, also known as 'The Living Room' resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.",
    "Containment": "SCP-002 must remain connected to a power supply to stay in a recharging state. During an electrical outage, evacuate the area, close the emergency barrier, and use X-ray and ultraviolet light bursts to re-establish power and return SCP-002 to recharging mode. The containment area should have negative air pressure. Teams of at least two people must be within 20 meters of SCP-002, maintaining physical contact to confirm each other's presence due to potential perception alterations near the object. Only Level 3 personnel or higher can access SCP-002, unless authorized by two Level 4 administrators, requiring escorts and post-contact procedures including quarantine and evaluation before returning to duty."

    "Subject": "SCP-003",
    "Class": "Euclid",
    "Description": "SCP-003, also known as 'Biological Motherboard', is a mysterious and potentially dangerous anomalous object in the fictional universe of the SCP Foundation. It appears as a complex mechanical and organic structure resembling a motherboard, with intricate circuitry and biological components. SCP-003 is capable of self-repair and has shown signs of life, making it a unique and enigmatic entity. Interactions with SCP-003 are strictly controlled due to its potential threat, and its true nature and origin remain largely unknown within the SCP Foundation lore.",
    "Containment": "SCP-003 requires consistent maintenance at temperatures above 35°C, ideally over 100°C, and must not be exposed to organisms of Category IV or higher complexity. In case of a power failure, personnel must make skin contact with SCP-003-1 to prevent mass increase, using body heat if possible. Anyone entering SCP-003's containment area must be checked for parasites and sterilized if necessary. SCP-003-1 must remain in SCP-003-2 unless during emergency procedures. Any changes in SCP-003-2's rune activity must be reported promptly, and it must always be powered by Generator 003-IX."

    "Subject": "SCP-004",
    "Class": "Euclid",
    "Description": "SCP-004, also known as 'The 12 Rusty Keys and the Door', is a containment object within the SCP Foundation universe. It consists of a set of twelve rusted keys, labeled SCP-004-1 through SCP-004-12, and an anomalous door, designated SCP-004-EX. The keys are required to unlock the door, but the specific order in which they must be used remains unknown.",
    "Containment": "Proper handling of SCP-004-2 to SCP-004-13 is crucial, requiring Level 4 security personnel for off-site movement. SCP-004 components should not be taken through SCP-004-1 due to unknown effects and impractical research costs. If any objects breach containment, the keys must be brought inside and the facility secured before initiating a warhead. Unauthorized key removal leads to termination. Access to SCP-004-1 requires Level 1 clearance, while SCP-004-2 to -13 require Level 4 clearance."

    "Subject": "SCP-005",
    "Class": "Safe",
    "Description": "SCP-005, also known as 'Skeleton Key', resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.",
    "Containment": "SCP-005 poses no immediate risk in any direct sense. Even so, its unique functions require special measures be taken to restrict access and manipulation of the object. Approval of at least one (1) Level 4 personnel is required for the removal of the object from its containment area."

    "Subject": "SCP-006",
    "Class": "Safe",
    "Description": "SCP-006, also known as 'Fountain of Youth', is an anomalous substance within the SCP Foundation universe. It appears as a clear, viscous liquid with potent regenerative properties. When applied to living organisms, SCP-006 can significantly reverse the aging process, promoting rapid cellular regeneration and extending the subject's lifespan.",
    "Containment": "SCP-006 requires secrecy rather than extensive containment. Personnel interacting with it must wear specific suits, undergo briefings, and be submerged to check for leaks. Procedures must be heavily monitored, with a code indicating high toxicity for evacuation. Liquid acquisition requires O5 approval and strict handling. Contact with SCP-006 leads to personnel termination via incineration after studies."
